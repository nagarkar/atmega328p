In this example, 
1. Test the HC_SR04 Ultrasonic sensor and run it to it's theoretical maximum limit of # of measurements/sec. As high as 800 measurements/sec are observed.
2. We use a library for handling pin change interrupts conveniently.

Configuration:
Nano
HC_SR04 connected to pin 8 (trig) and 7 (echo).

To Run this example, adjust the trigger and echo pins defined at the top of the QM model output file (open it in QM modeler) and then flash the nano board. Observe the serial output.
